This is a example perl script which was used in linux bash. 

The story is here, I broken my Surface Pro 3's screen, so the touch function doesn't work well, I install Elenmetary OS now, as a linux system, I can disable touch input, but anyway, I like this thing being done automatic, so now comes this script.
